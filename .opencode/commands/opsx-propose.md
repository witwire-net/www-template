Propose a new change - create the change and generate all artifacts in one step.

I'll create a change with the artifacts your schema defines. With the default spec-driven schema that is:

- proposal.md (what & why)
- `specs/<capability>/spec.md` (what the system must do - a delta, not the main spec)
- design.md (how)
- tasks.md (implementation steps)

When ready to implement, run /opsx-apply

---

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`, `view`). Other commands do not take the flag. Hints printed by commands already carry the flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root.

**Input**: The argument after `/opsx-propose` is the change name (kebab-case), OR a description of what the user wants to build.

Before artifact work, load `openspec-review` via the `skill` tool and use it as the sole semantic contract for Proposer self-review. Independent reviewers load the same contract under their own workflows.

**Intent confirmation boundary:** Treat the request as evidence of intent, not as an implementation-ready specification. Reconstruct and classify intent using `openspec-review`, repository evidence, assumptions, and falsification evidence. Obtain explicit owner confirmation before creating proposal, wireframe, Specs, design, or tasks; confirmation does not override the Skill's artifact routing.

**Artifact meaning boundary:** Use the artifact boundaries from `openspec-review` without adding a command-local interpretation.

**Change completion boundary:** Keep artifacts, tasks, acceptance criteria, and completion conditions repository-scoped. Do not include release execution, deployment, environment provisioning, credential access or probes, external approval, staging or production validation, operational rehearsal, or production observation.

**UI artifact order:** For a user-visible UI, use confirmed intent, proposal, `openspec/designer` wireframe JSON and generated evidence, Specs, design, then tasks. Treat `.wireframe.json` as the visible-surface source and generated HTML and screenshots as rendering evidence.

**Steps**

1. **If no input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Ask the user (open-ended, no preset options):

   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Create the change directory**

   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```

   This creates a scaffolded change in the planning home resolved by the CLI with `.openspec.yaml`.

3. **Get the artifact build order**

   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   Parse the JSON to get:
   - `applyRequires`: array of artifact IDs needed before implementation (e.g., `["tasks"]`)
   - `artifacts`: list of all artifacts, each with its `status` and its `requires` edges (the artifact IDs it directly depends on)
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, and `actionContext`: path and scope context. Use these instead of assuming repo-local paths.

4. **Create every artifact in the required set**

   Use a todo list to track progress through the artifacts.

   Loop through artifacts in dependency order (artifacts with no pending dependencies first):

   a. **For each artifact that is `ready` (dependencies satisfied)**:
   - Get instructions:
     ```bash
     openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
     ```
   - The instructions JSON includes:
     - `context`: Project background (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
     - `rules`: Artifact-specific rules (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
     - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
     - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
     - `skipped`/`warning`: present when the change declares skip_specs and this artifact must NOT be created - stop and pick another artifact
     - `resolvedOutputPath`: Resolved path or pattern to write the artifact
     - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context
   - Read any completed dependency files for context - always re-read them from disk, even if you saw them earlier in the conversation (the user may have edited them)
   - When creating `intent`, inspect repository evidence, present the complete reconstructed intent to the owner, and record explicit confirmation using the schema-required markers
   - Do not create any downstream artifact until the intent artifact is owner-confirmed and no material decision remains unresolved
   - If the `instruction` field delegates creation to a specific skill or command, invoke it to produce the artifact instead of writing the file yourself, then verify the artifact file exists at `resolvedOutputPath`
   - Otherwise create the artifact file using `template` as the structure and write it to `resolvedOutputPath`. If `resolvedOutputPath` is a glob, follow `instruction` to choose the concrete file path
   - Apply `context` and `rules` as constraints - but do NOT copy them into the file
   - Show brief progress: "Created <artifact-id>"

   b. **Continue until every artifact in the required set exists (not just `apply.requires`)**
   - After creating each artifact, re-run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`
   - The required set is `applyRequires` plus every artifact reachable from those by following the `requires` edges in `status --json` - walk them transitively (spec-driven closes over proposal, specs, design, tasks). Leave artifacts outside that set alone
   - `status` is file-existence only, so an `applyRequires` artifact reading `done` does NOT mean its dependencies exist - writing `tasks.md` early marks `tasks` done while `specs` was never written. Use each artifact's `requires` edges, not its `status`, to build the required set: a `done` artifact still lists what it depends on
   - An artifact already reading `status: "skipped"` is satisfied: the change declares `skip_specs` in `.openspec.yaml`, so its files must NOT exist. Never try to create one
   - Create every artifact in the required set that is missing, then re-check - creating one can unblock others
   - Skip one only when `status` already reports it `skipped`, or when its own `instruction` says it is conditional: run `openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json` and skip only if its `instruction` field marks it optional (e.g. "create only if..."). Spec-driven's `design.md` qualifies; `specs` qualifies only via the `skipped` status above, never by your own judgment. Tell the user, and do not reconsider it
   - Dependencies are enablers, not gates: if a required artifact is still `blocked` only because you skipped a conditional dependency, write it anyway
   - Stop when every artifact in the required set is `done`, `skipped`, or was deliberately skipped

   c. **If an artifact requires user input** (unclear context):
   - Ask the user to clarify
   - Then continue with creation

5. **Converge deterministic format and semantic review**

   Before calling Analyzer, Proposer must verify and correct:
   - Required artifacts and required sections
   - Remaining `TODO`, `TBD`, and equivalent placeholders
   - `Directory Tree` glyph format
   - Exact agreement between `Directory Tree` and `New / Changed Files`
   - Fixed headings, tables, and columns from the active templates
   - Numbered task checkboxes and objective task completion conditions
   - Scenario ID coverage by test tasks
   - Wireframe paths and the required UI artifact creation order

   Run these existing validations until they pass:

   ```bash
   openspec validate --type change "<name>" --strict --no-interactive
   pnpm lint:openspec
   ```

   Then read every `contextFiles` path from `openspec instructions apply --change "<name>" --json`, self-review with `openspec-review`, and correct every actionable finding. Call `openspec/analyzer` only after deterministic validation passes, passing the resolved `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, artifact paths, and store command context. Continue correction, validation, and review until Analyzer returns `APPROVED`. Do not send deterministic format defects to Analyzer.

6. **Show final status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

**Output**

After completing all artifacts, summarize:

- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions, plus any conditional artifact you skipped and why
- Strict validation results and the current Analyzer `APPROVED` evidence
- What's ready: "All artifacts needed for implementation are ready."
- Prompt: "Run `/opsx-apply` to start implementing."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the `instruction` field from `openspec instructions` for each artifact type - it is the authoritative guidance, even for familiar artifact names
- If the `instruction` field directs you to use a specific skill or command to create the artifact, invoke it instead of writing the artifact directly
- The schema defines what each artifact should contain - follow it
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use `template` as the structure for your output file - fill in its sections
- **IMPORTANT**: `context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU, not content for the file
  - Do NOT copy `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<project_context>` blocks into the artifact
  - These guide what you write, but should never appear in the output

**Guardrails**

- Create every artifact the apply phase transitively depends on, not just the ids listed in `apply.requires`
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one - re-read from disk, not from conversation memory (files may have changed since you last saw them)
- If ambiguity could change customer-visible behavior, contracts, architecture, security, data, dependencies, UI, or scope, ask the owner instead of resolving it for momentum
- If a change with that name already exists, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next
- Do not add semantic finding categories or local readiness gates beyond `openspec-review`
- Do not declare the Change review complete until Analyzer returns `APPROVED`
